## About the tool

A command-line tool allowing developers to find security vulnerabilities within a Java project. This is done through:

  potential CWE vulnerabilities.
- Software composition analysis (SCA) that identifies any outdated dependencies within the pom.xml file and their
  associated
  CVE vulnerabilities.

`pip install repelsec`
