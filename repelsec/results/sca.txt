ID - CVE-2023-24998
Artifact - commons-fileupload 1.3.2
Group - commons-fileupload
Description - Apache Commons FileUpload before 1.5 does not limit the number of request parts to be processed resulting in the possibility of an attacker triggering a DoS with a malicious upload or series of uploads.

          new configuration option (FileUploadBase#setFileCountMax) is not
          enabled by default and must be explicitly configured.
